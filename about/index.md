Hey, I'm Hugo.

This is my personal website/blog. Expect to find anything from programming to personal stuff.

I'm a, not so awesome, software engineer with a passion to be great, I enjoy solving problems at any level, be it technical or business.

I'm living in Tokyo, since I was a kid I've wanted to come to Japan, it's a magical weird place. I was in love with Japan before I came here and amazed every day since I got here. I work mainly as a full stack developer and am a generalist.

What do you like?

* Ruby and Ruby on Rails
* Roller skating
* Dancing salsa
* Learning and improving my abilities
* The art of software engineering (O.o)!
* Reading hacker news

Where can I find you?

At the usual suspects for a developer, try [github](http://github.com/GriffinHeart) or perhaps [twitter](https://twitter.com/leShadowGriff). I also have [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hfalmeida) and a [coderwall](https://coderwall.com/griffinheart).

If you really want you can also send me an email `hugofalmeida [at] gmail [dot] com`. (yes I'm a HOMM3 and FF fan)
